Fraud Detection Using Random Forests
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm. Fraud detection is a crucial problem for many industries, particularly financial institutions, where identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time can help reduce monetary losses and improve security.

The project goes through the full lifecycle of data preparation, model building, evaluation, and visualization, ultimately creating a robust classification system that can identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing data and applies transformations, such as encoding categorical variables, to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Splits the data into training and test sets.
Model Training:

Uses the Random Forest classifier from the scikit-learn library to build the model.
The training process leverages a forest of decision trees to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Performance Evaluation:

Evaluates the model using multiple performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualizes the model's performance using an ROC curve.
Final Results:

The model demonstrates strong performance in detecting fraudulent transactions, as indicated by the validation results.
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in the project:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For implementing the Random Forest algorithm and evaluating the model.
matplotlib and seaborn: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
