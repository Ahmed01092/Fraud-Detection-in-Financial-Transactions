Fraud Detection Using Random Forests

Project Overview
This project uses the Random Forest algorithm to build a fraud detection model.
Fraud detection is a crucial problem for many industries, particularly financial institutions, where identifying fraudulent transactions in real time can help reduce monetary losses and improve security.

The project goes through the full lifecycle of data preparation, model building, evaluation, and visualization, ultimately creating a robust classification system that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing data and applies transformations, such as encoding categorical variables, to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Splits the data into training and test sets.

Model Training:
Uses the Random Forest classifier from the scikit-learn library to build the model.
The training process leverages a forest of decision trees to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Performance Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using multiple performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualizes the model's performance using an ROC curve.

Final Results:
The model demonstrates strong performance in detecting fraudulent transactions, as indicated by the validation results.

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in the project:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For implementing the Random Forest algorithm and evaluating the model.
matplotlib and seaborn: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
